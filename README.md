# Harvard-s_Artifact_Collections
An interactive web application built with Streamlit was created for this project in order to examine and evaluate data from the Harvard Art Museums API. Its main goal is to dynamically get artifact data and display it in an understandable, visually appealing, and analytical manner.

Important points to note:

API Integration: Retrieves current artifact metadata, including titles, classifications, cultures, colors, media counts, and more, by connecting to the Harvard Art Museums API.

Dynamic Exploration: Users can explore, search, and filter objects by period, culture, or classification (such as paintings, coins, sculptures, or textiles).

Data Analysis Features:

Aggregates artifacts by categories like classification, culture, or media rank.

Supports statistical summaries such as artifact counts, average media counts, or distributions across categories.

Identifies trends (e.g., top-ranked artifacts, color patterns, or overrepresented cultures).

Interactive Visualizations: Makes use of Streamlit's plotting features (using libraries such as Matplotlib/Plotly/Altair) to display tables, graphs, and charts for more in-depth understanding.

 User Controls: Offers user-friendly controls (search fields, checkboxes, and dropdown menus) to customize the analysis process.

 Harvard-s_Artifact_Collections enhances the accessibility, insight, and engagement of cultural heritage collections by fusing art data, interactivity, and visual analytics.
